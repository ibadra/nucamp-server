## Features:

It allows performing several operations through the set up of various endpoints using HTTP methods (get, post, put, delete) for RESTful services.

The database that was used to work with this server was the NoSQL database, mongoDB. It also uses Mongoose as the Data Object Modeling library to add structure to the database.

This server application also has the feature of signing up to view some restricted information. The authentication method used is token based, which makes it really secure and simple to implement.\
